= Kisasa Claude Marketplace

A comprehensive marketplace of specialized AI agents, commands, and MCP server configurations for Claude Code. This marketplace brings a full product development team to your fingertips—complete with role-specific agents and commands that mimic how human teams collaborate, plan work, and build software.

== Why Kisasa?

Traditional development often requires juggling multiple perspectives: product strategy, user experience, technical architecture, marketing, and more. The Kisasa marketplace provides specialized agents that each bring deep expertise in their domain, allowing you to:

* *Get strategic product guidance* from a VP of Product
* *Refine user stories and manage backlogs* with a Product Manager
* *Design user-centered experiences* with a UX Designer
* *Architect complex systems* with a Principal Engineer
* *Analyze business requirements* with a Business Analyst
* *Facilitate domain modeling sessions* with an Event Stormer
* *Develop marketing strategies* with Marketing Leaders
* *And more...*

Beyond individual agents, Kisasa includes collaborative commands that orchestrate multiple agents together—simulating real team meetings and automatically generating organized work backlogs in Linear.

== Commands

Commands orchestrate multiple agents to simulate how human teams collaborate, plan work, and organize backlogs.

=== `/kisasa:meeting` - Collaborative Agent Meetings

*Usage:* `/kisasa:meeting [agent1,agent2,...] [topic] [meeting-notes-path]`

Facilitate strategic team meetings where multiple agents ideate, discuss trade-offs, and make decisions together. The command uses extended thinking mode to run through structured phases: agenda setting, round-robin discussion, decision making, action planning, and wrap-up.

*What it does:*

* Brings together specified agents to discuss a topic
* Facilitates structured discussions with multiple expert perspectives
* Tracks decisions, questions, risks, and action items
* Generates comprehensive meeting notes in markdown format
* Supports follow-up meetings with context from previous sessions

*Example prompts:*

* `/kisasa:meeting quimby,lisa,frink "new real-time collaboration feature" meeting-notes/collab-feature`
* `/kisasa:meeting marge,frink "checkout flow redesign" meeting-notes/checkout`
* `/kisasa:meeting martin,lisa "Q4 roadmap planning" meeting-notes/q4-planning`

*Output:*

* Displays meeting summary with key decisions and action items
* Saves detailed meeting notes to markdown file with full discussion, decision log, Q&A, risk register, and next steps

=== `/kisasa:linear-backlog` - Automated Linear Backlog Creation

*Usage:* `/kisasa:linear-backlog [agent1,agent2,...] [notes-path]`

Transform meeting notes into a fully-organized Linear backlog complete with issues, labels, workflows, and automated agent delegation via webhooks. This command handles the complete lifecycle: team setup, workflow configuration, issue creation, webhook bridge generation, and GitHub Actions integration.

*What it does:*

* Reads meeting notes to understand project scope
* Creates or locates your Linear team
* Configures workflow statuses (Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Review → Done)
* Creates label groups for Agents and Types
* Collaborates with specified agents to define issues with acceptance criteria
* Generates webhook bridge function (Vercel, AWS Lambda, Netlify, or Google Cloud)
* Creates GitHub Actions workflow for automatic agent delegation
* Documents the complete setup with deployment instructions

*Example prompts:*

* `/kisasa:linear-backlog lisa,frink,marge meeting-notes/collab-feature`
* `/kisasa:linear-backlog martin,quimby,lisa meeting-notes/checkout`

*Output:*

* Creates issues in Linear with full specifications
* Generates webhook bridge code for your chosen cloud provider
* Creates GitHub Actions workflow file
* Produces comprehensive setup documentation
* Provides deployment instructions

*The Magic:* When you move a Linear issue to "In Progress", the webhook bridge automatically:

. Detects the agent label on the issue
. Determines the branching strategy (parent/child relationships)
. Triggers GitHub Actions workflow
. Spins up Claude Code with the assigned agent
. Agent works on the issue following their expertise
. Creates a pull request linked back to Linear

== MCP Servers

This marketplace includes configuration for the following MCP servers:

=== Linear MCP Server

The Linear MCP server provides direct integration with Linear's workspace, enabling issue management, project tracking, and backlog organization. This is used by the Lisa agent and the `/kisasa:linear-backlog` command.

*Note:* Linear MCP configuration is handled automatically by the commands that need it.

== How It Works

=== Individual Agent Invocation

When you ask Claude Code for help that matches an agent's expertise, the agent is automatically engaged with their specialized knowledge and approach. Each agent operates with their own:

* Domain expertise and methodologies
* Communication style and perspective
* Quality standards and frameworks
* Tool access appropriate to their role

=== Collaborative Commands

The meeting and backlog commands orchestrate multiple agents together, simulating real team collaboration:

. *Meeting Command*: Facilitates structured discussions where agents debate trade-offs, ask questions, surface risks, and reach decisions together
. *Backlog Command*: Coordinates agents to break down work, then automates the entire Linear + GitHub integration setup

=== Automated Workflow

The `/kisasa:linear-backlog` command creates a complete automated workflow:

----
Linear Issue (Todo)
  → User moves to "In Progress"
    → Linear webhook fires
      → Webhook bridge validates and processes
        → GitHub Actions triggered
          → Claude Code spins up with agent
            → Agent implements feature
              → Pull Request created
                → Linked back to Linear issue
----

This mimics how human teams work: discuss → plan → assign → implement → review.
