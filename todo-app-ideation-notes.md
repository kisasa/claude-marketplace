# Strategic Ideation Meeting: ToDo List App

**Meeting Date**: 2025-10-18
**Participants**: Quimby (VP of Product), Marge (UX Designer), Lisa (Product Manager)
**Topic**: Creating a ToDo list app to manage things to remember

---

## Key Insights

**1. Market Differentiation is Critical**
The ToDo app market is extremely saturated with strong competitors (Todoist, Things, Microsoft To Do, Apple Reminders). Success requires a clear strategic angle:
- **Simplicity-first approach**: Compete on ease-of-use and speed rather than feature count
- **Niche targeting**: Consider specific user segments (e.g., parents, students, knowledge workers) rather than "everyone"
- **Novel positioning**: Privacy-first, offline-first, or AI-augmented task management

**2. The "Remembering" Problem is Different Than "Organizing"**
Your emphasis on "trying to remember to do" suggests the core value proposition is **capture and recall**, not complex project management. This insight drives a fundamentally different product:
- Ultra-fast task capture (under 2 seconds from thought to saved)
- Smart reminders based on context, not just time
- Forgiving UX that reduces guilt about incomplete tasks

**3. User Psychology Matters More Than Features**
Most ToDo apps fail not due to missing features, but because they create anxiety and friction:
- Seeing overdue tasks creates negative emotions
- Too many organizational options cause decision paralysis
- Notification fatigue leads to ignoring the app
- Context switching breaks flow states

**4. Mobile-First is Non-Negotiable**
Tasks come to mind throughout the day, not just at desks. The mobile experience must be:
- Offline-capable (can't lose thoughts due to connectivity)
- One-tap to add (widget, Siri/Google Assistant integration)
- Glanceable (see today's priorities without opening app)

**5. MVP Should Be Ruthlessly Simple**
The temptation will be to add subtasks, tags, priorities, projects, recurring tasks, etc. Resist. Start with:
- Add task, complete task, delete task
- Basic due dates and reminders
- One level of organization (lists OR projects, not both initially)

## Action Items

### Strategic (Quimby - VP of Product)
- [ ] Define target market segment (consumer vs professional, solo vs teams)
- [ ] Research 3-5 main competitors and identify gaps in their offerings
- [ ] Determine business model (freemium, subscription, one-time purchase)
- [ ] Decide platform strategy (web-first, mobile-first, or cross-platform MVP)
- [ ] Define 12-month product vision beyond MVP

### User Experience (Marge - UX Designer)
- [ ] Conduct user interviews with 5-10 people about their current task management approaches
- [ ] Map core user journey: Capture → Organize → Execute → Complete
- [ ] Design quick-capture interaction (aim for <2 seconds from launch to saved task)
- [ ] Create visual design system emphasizing calm, clarity, and accomplishment
- [ ] Prototype mobile and desktop experiences
- [ ] Test accessibility requirements (keyboard shortcuts, screen readers)

### Product Development (Lisa - Product Manager)
- [ ] Write detailed user stories for MVP features
- [ ] Define success metrics (activation rate, DAU, tasks completed per user, D7/D30 retention)
- [ ] Create technical requirements document including:
  - Data model (tasks, lists, users)
  - Sync strategy (offline-first recommended)
  - Tech stack decision (React/React Native, Vue, Flutter, or native)
- [ ] Set up project management system and sprint planning
- [ ] Identify technical dependencies (auth, backend, database, notifications)
- [ ] Create test plan including edge cases (offline mode, sync conflicts, data loss scenarios)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Strategic Clarity Before Building
**Don't start coding yet.** First answer:
1. Who specifically is this for? (Not "everyone")
2. What's the ONE thing we do better than existing apps?
3. Why would users switch from their current solution?

**Recommendation**: Spend 2-3 weeks on user research and competitive analysis before writing code.

### Priority 2: Start Mobile-Only
**Why**: Tasks come to mind on-the-go. Building mobile-first forces ruthless simplicity.

**Recommendation**:
- iOS-only initially (smaller surface area, easier to nail the experience)
- OR Progressive Web App (works everywhere, simpler to maintain)
- Delay desktop app until mobile MVP validates product-market fit

### Priority 3: Optimize for Capture Speed
**The #1 metric for MVP**: Time from "I have a task" to "task is saved"

**Recommendation**:
- Target: <2 seconds to add a task
- Support: Widget, Siri/Assistant shortcuts, share sheet integration
- Default to simplest input: just text, no required fields

### Priority 4: Three-Month MVP Scope
**Core features only**:
- ✅ Add task (with optional due date)
- ✅ View tasks (today, upcoming, all)
- ✅ Complete/uncomplete task
- ✅ Delete task
- ✅ Basic lists/projects (one level max)
- ✅ Simple reminders
- ✅ Offline support with sync

**Explicitly NOT in MVP**:
- ❌ Subtasks
- ❌ Tags
- ❌ Priority levels
- ❌ Recurring tasks
- ❌ Collaboration/sharing
- ❌ Attachments
- ❌ Time tracking

### Priority 5: Define Technical Foundation
**Critical decisions needed**:
1. **Authentication**: Build vs. use Firebase/Supabase/Auth0
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL (structured) vs. MongoDB (flexible) vs. Firebase (real-time)
3. **Sync**: Offline-first architecture (recommended) vs. online-only
4. **Hosting**: Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Railway)

**Recommendation**: Use proven tools (Firebase/Supabase) for MVP to focus on product, not infrastructure.

## Next Steps to Take Now

If you want to proceed, I recommend:

1. **Answer the strategic questions** (Who is this for? What's the differentiation?)
2. **Conduct 5-10 user interviews** about current task management pain points
3. **Sketch key screens** for task capture, task list, and task completion flows
4. **Make technical stack decision** based on your skills and MVP timeline
5. **Build a throwaway prototype** (1-2 days) to test core interaction feel

## Perspectives Considered

**Quimby (VP of Product)**: Market positioning, competitive differentiation, business model, long-term vision, monetization strategy

**Marge (UX Designer)**: User psychology, interaction design, accessibility, emotional design, mobile vs desktop patterns, reducing friction

**Lisa (Product Manager)**: MVP scope, user stories, technical requirements, success metrics, risk mitigation, dependencies, launch strategy
